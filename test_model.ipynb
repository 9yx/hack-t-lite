      "   - **Thoughts:** We'll need to store your transaction data in a file for later analysis. This will be our input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Categorization:**\n",
      "   - **Command:** \"analyze_expenses\", \"transactions\": \"expenses.txt\"\n",
      "   - **Thoughts:** This command will categorize your transactions into predefined categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment, etc.). It will also provide a summary of the total spent in each category.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Identifying Savings Opportunities:**\n",
      "   - **Command:** \"search_files\", \"directory\": \"expenses/\"\n",
      "   - **Thoughts:** We'll look for patterns in the data to find areas where you might be overspending. For instance, if you spend a lot on dining out, we can suggest reducing that amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Suggesting Savings Strategies:**\n",
      "   - **Command:** \"write_to_file\", \"file\": \"savings_plan.txt\", \"\n"
